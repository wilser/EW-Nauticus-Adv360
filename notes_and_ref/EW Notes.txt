EW Notes

    - adv360.keymap seems the only file need to edit / unless split out some *.dtsi to include and if edit those sections
    - keymap.json = seems only needed to drive the online GUI
    - send Mod+CHAR like functions: <L|R><S|C|A|G> Left or Right | Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Win(GUI) - https://zmk.dev/docs/codes/modifiers 
        E.g.: &kp RC(LA(B)) sends Ctrl+Alt+B (using r-ctrl, and l-alt)
    &lt <#> <char> = Hold layer # unless quick then output <char>

    "sticky layer" &sl # - is same as "one shot layer" toggle in QMK

    Inside the JSON parts, comments aren't allowed; but people do like _comment: "some comment here"

MODS
    - when used inline (not just solo key, but F(x) style), then must do the short form: LS(A) (Left-Shift + A), not LSHIFT, or other variations.

MACRO fun...
    [x] using functions inside one string &macro_tap NOT working; e.g. using LC(LEFT)
            <&macro_tap &kp LC(LEFT) &kp LC(LS(RIGHT))>
    [x] more simple didn't work - is it the FUNC uses?
            <&kp LC(LEFT)>, <&kp LC(LS(RIGHT))>
    [v] basic a, then b, then c as separate an no mods WORKED fine

    If need LONGER THAN 64 actions (and &kp is two: down, up) - then revisit the "behavior queue limit"...

    TIMINGS...
        wait-time = pause *between* each action in the "bindings=" list. Default is 100ms
        tap-time  = time a tap is 'held' when emulating press. Default is 100ms
        default = 100
        20-30 seems much tidier; caution if too close on the tap-ms can cause issues
        Seems need 40 for some cases of reliability with modifiers

    Sending F13-F24 - NEEDS WORKARONUD

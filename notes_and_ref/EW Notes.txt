Standards/ conventions:
    For mod-tap, morphs, etc. - abbreviations for names:
        H- hold behavior
        T- tap behavior
        TT- 2x-tap behavior (TTT, etc)



EW Notes

    - adv360.keymap seems the only file need to edit / unless split out some *.dtsi to include and if edit those sections
    - keymap.json = seems only needed to drive the online GUI
    - send Mod+CHAR like functions: <L|R><S|C|A|G> Left or Right | Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Win(GUI) - https://zmk.dev/docs/codes/modifiers 
        E.g.: &kp RC(LA(B)) sends Ctrl+Alt+B (using r-ctrl, and l-alt)
    &lt <#> <char> = Hold layer # unless quick then output <char>
    &mo <lr#> = hold for that layer, return when release (use &lt instead if want quick tap to do something different)

    "sticky layer" &sl # - is same as "one shot layer" toggle in QMK

    Inside the JSON parts, comments aren't allowed; but people do like _comment: "some comment here"

    LED (small) timeouts - see inside adv360_left_defconfig & ...right... // think (ms) timing

MODS
    - when used inline (not just solo key, but F(x) style), then must do the short form: LS(A) (Left-Shift + A), not LSHIFT, or other variations.

MACRO fun...
    [x] using functions inside one string &macro_tap NOT working; e.g. using LC(LEFT)
            <&macro_tap &kp LC(LEFT) &kp LC(LS(RIGHT))>
    [x] more simple didn't work - is it the FUNC uses?
            <&kp LC(LEFT)>, <&kp LC(LS(RIGHT))>
    [v] basic a, then b, then c as separate an no mods WORKED fine

    If need LONGER THAN 64 actions (and &kp is two: down, up) - then revisit the "behavior queue limit"...

    TIMINGS...
        wait-time = pause *between* each action in the "bindings=" list. Default is 100ms
        tap-time  = time a tap is 'held' when emulating press. Default is 100ms
        default = 100
        20-30 seems much tidier; caution if too close on the tap-ms can cause issues
        Seems need 40 for some cases of reliability with modifiers


Macro Notes

    Sending F13-F24 - NEEDS WORKARONUD
        /* simple F11 send works fine... A simple send F16 seems to do nothing... Is it the ≥F12 cases that's the issue? */
        /* related to this option? https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/issues/1460 ... ?  commented out this in 2 files (left, right): CONFIG_ZMK_HID_REPORT_TYPE_NKRO=y */
        /* ******** YES YES ^^ commenting out this option then worked!  ********** */
        /*
        m_TestF11: m_TestF11 {
            wait-ms = <100>;
            tap-ms = <100>;
            compatible = "zmk,behavior-macro";
            #binding-cells = <0>;
            bindings = <&kp F11>;
        };

[ ] MACRO TODO - simplified helper function - only specify what's different
/* try ZMK macro helper shortcut -- NOT WORKING with nested FN() calls -- come back to later? */

ISSUES & NOTES
    2024-01-05 Win+<> timing and REMOTE DESKTOP
        Util+{SR-shortcut} Ø work on remote-laptop / but the normal Meh+R does. WTH?
		seems to send like CS-R or CA-R, not whole combo... Keyboard/ZMK issue?
		seems known bug 2021? https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/issues/759
			one person says on RDP issue, but Windows-Store "RDP Classic" Ø have the issue?
			one wondered if BT v USB could impact
			one says also affects capsWORD sometimes (but maybe only certain OSes)
			[.] ** one suggests macro: <down>key<up> etc. **
				this reply has good Macro template: https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/issues/759#issuecomment-1348836836
				[ ] if do this ^, make note to re-visit after if/when upgrade baseline firmware
				also relevant: https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/issues/986
				✔️ so far works!
			[❌] "run Windows Shortcuts on the client only" RDP option?
				"windows" key not officially supported, so hit and miss - and might be better in "full screen" mode than windowed - https://superuser.com/questions/815583/remote-desktop-sending-windows-key-shortcuts-to-both-local-machine-and-to-remote
				options? https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/rdp-files
				seems best is "keyboardhook:i:1" but that's already the setting ... Hrm
					https://superuser.com/questions/1456642/windows-keyboard-shortcuts-wont-work-in-remote-desktop
			[?..] wonder if this would also have fixed the Clipmate issues... Seems so

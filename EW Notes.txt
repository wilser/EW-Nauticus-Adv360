EW Notes

    - adv360.keymap seems the only file need to edit / unless split out some *.dtsi to include and if edit those sections
    - keymap.json = seems only needed to drive the online GUI
    - send Mod+CHAR like functions: <L|R><S|C|A|G> Left or Right | Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Win(GUI) - https://zmk.dev/docs/codes/modifiers 
        E.g.: &kp RC(LA(B)) sends Ctrl+Alt+B (using r-ctrl, and l-alt)
    &lt <#> <char> = Hold layer # unless quick then output <char>

    "sticky layer" &sl # - is same as "one shot layer" toggle in QMK

    MACRO fun...
        [x] using functions inside one string &macro_tap NOT working; e.g. using LC(LEFT)
                <&macro_tap &kp LC(LEFT) &kp LC(LS(RIGHT))>
        [x] more simple didn't work - is it the FUNC uses?
                <&kp LC(LEFT)>, <&kp LC(LS(RIGHT))>
        [v] basic a, then b, then c as separate an no mods WORKED fine

        TIMINGS...
            wait = bef. start
            tap  = between keystrokes (I think)
            default = 100
            20-30 seems much tidier; caution if too close on the tap-ms can cause issues
            Seems need 40 for some cases of reliability with modifiers

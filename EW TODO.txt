EW TODO
    [ ] !! Toprow Mods not being combined...?? 
    [V] figure how other layer-holds work
    [ ] figure how to make Hyper & Meh
    [ ] figure plain key-hold for other function
    [ ] figure tap-tap & tap-hold ways
    [ ] figure basic ASCII code macro
    [ ] revisit the various conditional holds (diff. options, diff. timings) / & see new-ish blog entries on other options recently added
    [ ] seems "sticky layers" are like the One-Shot-KEY from Moonlander
    [ ] how to 'hold to shift' like the punctuation
    [ ] tinker with capsWORD settings - like Char-list



Maybe
    [ ] whole "activate layer, but it's a stack" concept? (seems different than the standard "transparent" setting)
